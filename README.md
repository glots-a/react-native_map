Hello!!!
To run the code locally, you need the GOOGLE_API_KEY.
This key was stored in the environments.ts file when performing the test task.
Do not consider the absence of this file in this repository a mistake.
And of course, it's good form when private data is not publicly available.
If you do not have a personal GOOGLE_API_KEY, I will send it to you :)
